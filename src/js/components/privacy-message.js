                          When you sign up, you enter your email address, a nickname
                          (if you’re a student), and a password. We also record your
                          participation in quizzes, the answers you give, the medals and trophies you receive, and your overall
                          scores. Your email address is probably the most sensitive thing we record, as it’s the only thing that
                          uniquely identifies you. We use your data for several things:
                      </div>
                      <ul>
                          <li> We use your email address for login and user identification
                          – you enter your email address and password to log in. This
                          means your quiz scores and participation are linked to
                          your email address.
                          </li>
                          <li> Your scores on the quizzes you take are recorded,
                          and these scores are used to award badges, operate a
                          leaderboard and give you feedback on your performance.
                          </li>
                          <li> If you are a <i>student</i>, your lecturer or person setting
                          the quiz will be able to see your email address and
                          associated quiz scores and participation.
                          Lecturers will be able to use your email address according
                          to their institution’s rules and policies.
                          Most frequently this would be to award prizes or other
                          recognition for top scorers, or to check the situation
                          if you miss several quizzes or don’t score well across
                          many of them. Other students will only be able to see your
                          nickname – for example on the public leaderboard – they will
                          not be able to identify you unless you choose a nickname
                          that makes it obvious who you are.
                          </li>
                          <li> If you are a <i>student</i> it is also possible that
                          somebody other than your lecturer will be able to see your
                          data. We have the option of a group admin account type,
                          which is designed for programme or course directors who
                          want to see how things are going across a number of different
                          lecturers or modules that they are responsible for.
                          If someone is given this account, they will be able to
                          see data on your performance and participation across
                          everal modules or quiz series. Again, this is designed
                          so that course directors can award prizes for performance
                          across different modules (like a best-in-year award),
                          or identify students who may need extra support.
                          </li>
                          <li> If you are a <i>student</i>, your data may be shared with
                          your institution, and your email address may be used by
                          your institution to cross-tabulate Quodl data with data
                          about you held by your university, such as module enrolment,
                          assessment scores and data from your virtual learning environment
                          like moodle. This could be done for several reasons, including:
                          (1) to allow integration with virtual learning environments
                          like moodle, (2) to get a better picture of how individual
                          students are engaging with their course, (3) to try to
                          identify across students strategies that lead to successful
                          outcomes. In all cases, the primary aim would be to improve
                          your learning experience and outcomes, and those of students
                          who follow you. </li>
                          <li> Anonymised data may be used for scientific or commercial
                          research, such as better understanding how students learn,
                          factors affecting learning and performance, and how best
                          to predict performance. </li>
                          <li> If you are a <i>lecturer</i>, and your account was set up
                          by a group admin (usually the course director), the
                          group admin will have access to data on your students’
                          performance, which will also allow them to determine
                          things like the number of students taking your quizzes,
                          and the number of quizzes you have run.
                          </li>

                              with a link to reset it.
                          </li>
                          <li>

                              If you are a lecturer, we also use your email address
                              for verification; by sending an email to the address
                              you give us to confirm that the email address is yours.

                      <div className="subtitle">
                          People are sometimes worried about their data being
                          used to make significant decisions automatically, without
                          human intervention.Quodl may share performance with your
                          institution, and may use patterns of performance across
                          quizzes to highlight or categorise performance, for example,
                          so that lecturers can easily identify students who seem
                          to be doing well or badly. But it does not make automated
                          decisions – any decisions to act on that information
                          will be taken by a real person.
